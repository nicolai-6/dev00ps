# simple mouse mover that prevents any collaboration tool from changing status to "away" :)
    - includes some fixes to never reach the borders of the display (resolution) 
    -> otherwise could make "pyautogui" package crash
    - includes some fixes for multi monitor usage (still maybe only runs with one active display, depending on the OS)

## RUNBOOK
    - optionally adjust constants.py
    - install requirements and run main.py
